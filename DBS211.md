## Introduction to Databases

### Data vs. Information

- **Data**: Unprocessed facts (e.g., customer details, course information)
- **Information**: Processed data revealing meaning (e.g., credit card statements)

**Importance**: Accurate and timely information is crucial for decision-making.

### File Systems vs. Databases

**File Systems**:
- Programs written for specific data access
- Issues: Data redundancy, retrieval difficulty, structure inflexibility

**Databases**:
- Single repository for logically related data
- Types: Centralized and Distributed

**Advantages of Databases**:
- Improved information retrieval
- Data sharing
- Controlled redundancy
- Enhanced security
- Increased productivity

**Disadvantages**:
- Larger file sizes
- Increased complexity
- Greater impact of failures

### Database Management System (DBMS)

**Definition**: Software that manages database structure and access

**Importance**:
- Supports strategic and tactical decision-making
- Provides timely operational data

### Database Design

- **Purpose**: Defines database use, avoids redundancy
- **Process**: Part of Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
- **Strategies**: Top-down, Bottom-up, Centralized, Decentralized

## SQL Commands

### Data Definition Language (DDL)

- **Purpose**: Defines the structure of a database (e.g., tables, schemas, relationships)
- **Commands**:

  - **[CREATE](#create)**: Create a new table or database
    - Example:
      ```sql
      CREATE TABLE Employees (
          EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
          FirstName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
          LastName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
          Age INT CHECK (Age > 18),
          Department VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
      );
      ```

  - **[ALTER](#alter)**: Modify an existing database object
    - Example:
      ```sql
      ALTER TABLE Employees
      ADD Email VARCHAR(100);
      ```

  - **[DROP](#drop)**: Delete a table, database, or object
    - Example:
      ```sql
      -- Drop the foreign key constraint first if applicable
      ALTER TABLE Orders
      DROP CONSTRAINT FK_EmployeeID;

      -- Now drop the Employees table
      DROP TABLE Employees;
      ```

  - **[TRUNCATE](#truncate)**: Remove all records from a table
    - Example:
      ```sql
      TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;
      ```

### Data Manipulation Language (DML)

- **Purpose**: Manipulates data within tables
- **Commands**:

  - **[INSERT](#insert)**: Add new records
    - Example:
      ```sql
      INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Age, Department, Email)
      VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', 30, 'HR', 'john.doe@example.com');
      ```

  - **[SELECT](#select)**: Query records
    - Example:
      ```sql
      SELECT EmployeeID AS ID, FirstName AS "First Name", LastName AS "Last Name", Age, Department AS Dept
      FROM Employees
      WHERE Age > 25;
      ```

  - **[UPDATE](#update)**: Modify existing records
    - Example:
      ```sql
      UPDATE Employees
      SET Age = 31, Department = 'Finance'
      WHERE EmployeeID = 1;
      ```

  - **[DELETE](#delete)**: Remove records
    - Example:
      ```sql
      DELETE FROM Employees
      WHERE EmployeeID = 1;
      ```

### Joins

- **Purpose**: Joins are used to combine data from multiple tables based on related columns.

  - **[Implicit Join](#implicit-join)**: Performed using a WHERE clause.
    - Example:
      ```sql
      SELECT Employees.FirstName, Employees.LastName, Orders.OrderID
      FROM Employees, Orders
      WHERE Employees.EmployeeID = Orders.EmployeeID;
      ```
    - **Explanation**: This is an implicit join, where the tables `Employees` and `Orders` are joined using the `WHERE` clause. This style is less preferred now, as explicit joins are clearer.

  - **[Explicit Join](#explicit-join)**: Using the `JOIN` keyword for clarity.

    - Example:
      ```sql
      SELECT Employees.FirstName, Employees.LastName, Orders.OrderID
      FROM Employees
      INNER JOIN Orders ON Employees.EmployeeID = Orders.EmployeeID;
      ```
    - **Explanation**: This is an explicit join using the `INNER JOIN` keyword, which is more readable and provides clearer intent. The join is performed on the `EmployeeID` column.

  - **[CROSS JOIN](#cross-join)**: Returns the Cartesian product of both tables.
    - Example:
      ```sql
      SELECT Employees.FirstName, Orders.OrderID
      FROM Employees
      CROSS JOIN Orders;
      ```
    - **Explanation**: The `CROSS JOIN` returns all possible combinations of rows from the `Employees` and `Orders` tables, which may lead to a very large result set if the tables contain many rows. Use carefully.

  - **[INNER JOIN](#inner-join)**: Only returns rows where there is a match in both tables.
    - Example:
      ```sql
      SELECT Employees.FirstName, Orders.OrderID
      FROM Employees
      INNER JOIN Orders ON Employees.EmployeeID = Orders.EmployeeID;
      ```
    - **Explanation**: The `INNER JOIN` returns only the rows where the `EmployeeID` exists in both `Employees` and `Orders` tables. Non-matching rows are excluded.

  - **[LEFT JOIN](#left-join)**: Returns all rows from the left table, and matched rows from the right table.
    - Example:
      ```sql
      SELECT Employees.FirstName, Orders.OrderID
      FROM Employees
      LEFT JOIN Orders ON Employees.EmployeeID = Orders.EmployeeID;
      ```
    - **Explanation**: The `LEFT JOIN` returns all rows from the `Employees` table and the matching rows from the `Orders` table. If no match is found, the result will contain `NULL` for columns from the `Orders` table.

  - **[RIGHT JOIN](#right-join)**: Returns all rows from the right table, and matched rows from the left table.
    - Example:
      ```sql
      SELECT Employees.FirstName, Orders.OrderID
      FROM Employees
      RIGHT JOIN Orders ON Employees.EmployeeID = Orders.EmployeeID;
      ```
    - **Explanation**: The `RIGHT JOIN` returns all rows from the `Orders` table and the matching rows from the `Employees` table. If no match is found, the result will contain `NULL` for columns from the `Employees` table.

### Advanced SQL Concepts

#### [Views](#views)

- **Definition**: A virtual table created by a query, which presents data from one or more tables in a structured manner.
- **Usage**:
  - Example:
    ```sql
    CREATE VIEW EmployeeInfo AS
    SELECT EmployeeID AS ID, FirstName AS "First Name", LastName AS "Last Name", Age, Department AS Dept
    FROM Employees
    WHERE Age > 25;
    ```

#### [Calculated Fields](#calculated-fields)

- **Definition**: Fields that are not stored in the database but are generated by performing calculations on other fields.
- **Example**:
  - Create a calculated field to find the total salary with bonus:
    ```sql
    SELECT FirstName AS "Employee Name", LastName AS "Surname", Salary, Bonus,
           (Salary + Bonus) AS TotalCompensation
    FROM Employees;
    ```
